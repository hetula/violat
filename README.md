# ViolaT Music Player
ViolaT is terminal based Music player written in C.

## Dependencies
I'm building with clang 4.0.0 but 3.8 should also be enough or
lower if optimisations are tweaked.
```
clang
cmake
pulseaudio
gstreamer1.0
gstreamer1.0-plugins
glib-2.0 (gobject)
```
I'm using CLion but using cmake to build from terminal should work as well.

## Supported file formats
Depends on your gstreamer plugins.
